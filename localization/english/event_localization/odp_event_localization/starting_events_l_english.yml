 starting_story_event.1.desc:0 "The land of the Synahisanites is in a sorry state, divided into unending petty countesses. Hundreds lay claim to the land that my grandmother once united and only a few swear fealty to me. It angers me to even think about it, how they disrespect Hisan and the Prophet Galitia with their blasphemy.\n\nMy sister Hafkal sits about, content to play with herself and her court. She has no ambition, no drive. My cousin Zofia is perhaps the only one I can respect, although she flouts the word of Galitia by being one of the Aljisani.\n\nThe word of Hisan has been corrupted and it is my duty to cleanse this corruption and unite the faith like my grandmother before me."
 starting_story_event.1.a:0 "In the name of Hisan, most beautiful and most merciful."
