 kahlaston_visit_event.2.desc.green:0 "The Moss Kahlaston is old and weathered, yet still beautiful. As it stretches into the sky, so too does the surrounding nature.

There are a few things I could pray for, but what, exactly?\n\nThe crowd comes to a stop and we all get down on our knees, bowing our heads in prayer.
