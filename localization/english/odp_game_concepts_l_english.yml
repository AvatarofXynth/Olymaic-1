 game_concept_prophet_galitia_desc:0 "The Prophet Galitia is a woman central to the Synahisan faith. She was the first and only prophet of Hisan, and spread her god's message through the world with words and war. She is considered a shining example of what a Synahisanite should be, and most women aspire to be like her. \n To nonbelievers, Galitia was a madwoman who used her so called 'divine mother' as a means to do as she pleased. Many critics outside of the faith detest it, believing that she had turned what was once a peaceful and unique religion into one of debauchery and violence."
